# Translation
translateInstructionsString=Thanks for volunteering to help translate 'Archive This' into another language! Below, you will find all the text currently used by this add-on. For most languages, I've tried to give you a starting point using an automatic translation. All you need to do is go through and change all the strings so that they make sense in the language you're translating into.\n\nYou should look for two different kinds of lines below. The first looks like this:\n\n  ruleString0=If %1$S is %2$S, move to folder %3$S\n\nFor these lines, translate into your selected language (or check the existing translation). The "%1$S" things are where the program will substitute strings -- make sure they end up in the right place.\n\nThe second kind of line you'll want to change looks like this:\n\n  <!ENTITY filter_move_to_folder "Move to folder">\n\nFor these lines, all you need to do is replace the text inside the quotes.\n\nOnce you're done, just hit "send," and your translation will be included in the next version.\n\nIf you have any notes about your translation, please include them here:
